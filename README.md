# ArduinoSmartLock
In the past few years, security has become a major concern for everyone. Especially, for parents who are both working and need to take help from baby sitters, care takers and/or kids who have grown up enough to stay alone at home. These parents have a constant fear of someone breaking in their locks and harming their children. Apart from that, many business owners and big home owners have expressed concerns about needing a better security system. Therefore, we have developed a lock system that is not only smart and digital but also efficient and elegant. 

In this repository, a description of the smart lock system developed as part of the final project for course CS 207 at the University of Regina, taken under the guidance of Prof. Trevor Tomesh, is given. The project is a modification of an existing smart lock  based on Arduino which uses a keypad for authentication, the base project “Door lock system with Arduino” is created on https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub by the user jayesh_nawani . As an improvement to the project, RFID reader and tags are used for authentication, along with a solenoid lock that can be used in real life. Further information on the base project and the modifications have been provided in the next section.

Conclusion
============
All in all, the old key-based locks have been proved to be vulnerable to break ins. Supporting the fact that smarter home systems are required to be put at work. The first step would be to use a smart lock that can be controlled by simple yet efficient technologies like RFID, NIC and even mobile application control systems. For lower budgets, the project described in this paper is ideal for replacing key-based locks. This would not only ensure more security but has the possibility of having a full version of home security system. The home owners, more importantly working parents need to install such systems to have a more stress-free life.
